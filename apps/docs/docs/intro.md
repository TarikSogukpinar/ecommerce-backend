**Quick Start: Mock Store API**

This Mock Store API is a fully-featured, open-source project built using **Go, Nest.js, and CockroachDB**. It simulates a modern e-commerce platform where users can interact with products, view product details, manage orders, and make purchases. The API is designed to provide a realistic environment for developers looking to integrate, extend, or experiment with an e-commerce backend.

The Mock Store API offers RESTful endpoints for various e-commerce operations, including user management, product catalog, and order processing.
